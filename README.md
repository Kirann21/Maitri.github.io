"I always said that to get India stronger, first strengthen its roots, and all our roots are our country's interiors, rural areas, and villages."
                                                                                                                                 -Raveena Tandon

The quote above reflects the urgent needs of our society to strengthen itself economically as well as bring create an healthy environment for people from all sections. India has over three million Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO)  among which approximately 50000 of them are women empowered that work across a range of arenas and play important roles of facilitator, catalyst or partner in bringing social transformation. 

Our website Maitri works on the agenda of strengthening the B2B and B2C business models of the rural areas. 

Despite of the various government employment schemes and NGOs schemes in the rural areas, there are some dots which do not connect when it comes to projecting those products in the market.

This is where we come in!

We provide these NGOs and even the individual sellers to Contant Us through our portal. We take information about their products and check its quality and list their items on our site. In this way they are able to connect with the wholesalers and people across the globe.
This provides them with a steady income and connects all the dots between the sellers, marketers and buyers. Our website works for such root level organisations which fail to connect with the challenging world fail to showcase their talents. 

From handmade sarees to pottery items, from gorgeous handmade bangles to reusable jute items, everything can be listed and put for sale.


# Challenges We ran into

Using wordpress on the local server was a challenge in itself as many of the features were not working properly and getting disabled.

Using wordpress without the plugins like elemenetor was a challenge as making the theme look better and enhancing the user experience was tough.

Setting up a live host for the dynamic site using GitHub was a challenge for us as we are beginners.

Adding custom CSS codes to the site was a challenge as it was repeatedly messing up with the default CSS codes of WordPress similar issues were occuring with the use of custom HTML codes.
